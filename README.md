# AeroORMFramework

This is a mini - framework which was coded by me for educational purposes. 
This framework simplifies the process of working with SQL Server database.

Now (11.04.2019) the connector class (the main class where framework's api is) enables programmer to
1) Add table of a given type
2) Get all records from a table
3) Get the list of records which satisfies the given condition
4) Insert new record
5) Delete table
6) Delete record
7) Get a single record
8) Update record
